# OpenInfoMan

OpenInfoMan is XQuery and RESTXQ based implementation of the <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Care_Services_Discovery">Care Services Discovery (CSD)</a> profile from IHE which implements the following actors and transactions:

    Info Manager : Find Matching Services (Ad-Hoc and Stored) [ITI-73]
                   Query for Updated Services Transaction [ITI-74]
    Services Directory : Query for Updated Services Transaction [ITI-74]

OpenInfoMan has been developed as part of <a href="http://ohie.org">OpenHIE</a> and is intended to be the engine behind the CSD compliant <a href="https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/Health+Worker+Registry+Community">Health Worker Registry</a> and to be incorporated in <a href="http://openhim.org/">OpenHIM</a>.

## CSD Schema

You can find documentation for the CSD schema data mode  <a href="http://openhie.github.io/openinfoman/CSD.html">here</a> which has be generated from <a href="https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/blob/master/resources/CSD.xsd">CSD.xsd</a>

## Ubuntu Installation

You can easily install on Ubuntu 14.x and 16.x using the following commands
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openhie/release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openinfoman
```

Note that the Debian packaging creates an `openinfoman` user. 

Once you have installed the package, you should be able to access OpenInfoMan at:
> http://localhost:8984/CSD

## CentOS Manual Installation

Requirements are a Java Runtime Environment (Java 8 for the current [1.4.58] release), PHP, git, wget, and unzip. Note that php-xml is an additional requirement for CentOS.

```sh
sudo yum install -y git wget unzip java-1.8.0-openjdk php php-xml
```

The default ingress point is TCP port 8984. Ensure that port 8984 is unblocked. For example:
```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8984/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

> OpenInfoMan runs on an unprivileged port. Any user can manage the processes. See notes on production deployments below.

Once requirements are created, install OpenInfoMan using the provided script in [resources/scripts](https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/tree/master/resources/scripts)


```sh
# locally
bash resources/scripts/install.sh
# or on a remote host
ssh user@IP_ADDR 'bash -s' < install.sh
```

To install additional libraries:
```sh
# locally
bash resources/scripts/install_additional.sh
# or on a remote host
ssh user@IP_ADDR 'bash -s' < install_additional.sh
```

## Remote Installation with Ansible (CentOS only)

A series of Ansible playbooks are available in [resources/scripts](https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/tree/master/resources/scripts) and should be used in this order:

Order | File | Privileges Req | Purpose
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | ansible_backup.yaml | non-sudo | Backs up any OpenInfoMan data and logs by default into `~/backup`. This should be amended for S3 buckets or other storage as well. There is an additional backup backup in the install script, but this one is recommended.
2 | ansible_prep.yaml | sudo | Ensures the required dependencies are installed.
3 | ansible_install.yaml | non-sudo | Installs base OpenInfoMan. No additional libraries are installed. Most use cases require more libraries.
4 | ansible_install_test.yaml | non-sudo | Tests to ensure that OIM is running and has some functionality. A first-level support method.
5 | ansible_install_datim.yaml | non-sudo | DATIM additional libraries. If you want to install additional libaries other than just the DATIM ones (which include only DHIS2 and DATIM) then do not use this playbook. Use the install_additional.sh script instead.
6 | ansible_install_datim_test.yaml | non-sudo | Tests to ensure the DATIM libraries are running correctly. A first level support tool.
If needed | ansible_restore.yaml | non-sudo | Restores the latest backup from `~/backup/data`.

### Considerations

To use Ansible, your SSH public key should be in `.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host and you must also create an /etc/ansible/hosts or similar with the IP address or hostname of the remote host. An `ansible/hosts` file that has an entry for localhost and one server would be:

```sh
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[servers]
172.16.174.137
```
Ansible will require sudo privileges but these should be specified at runtime using the `--ask-become-pass` flag.

> Note: The DATIM OpenInfoMan library requires access to a private repository. Cloning the repo is necessary for the DATIM installation so the remote host must be able to access the private repo. The recommended way to do this is to use SSH agent forwarding. Arranging this is beyond the scope of this document. See the [GitHub guide to SSH agent forwarding](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding). On CentOS, SSH agent forwarding is off by default. Change this in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`. Also note the issue with connecting from [Macs](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254468/macos-sierra-doesn-t-seem-to-remember-ssh-keys-between-reboots)


The install playbooks invoke bash installation scripts. These do not remove data and logs, but always ensure to backup. See backup and restore below.

To run the full set of Ansible playbooks for an initial installation including a backup if it OpenInfoMan used to exist:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_backup.yaml
# on centos only
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_prep.yaml
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_install.yaml
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_install_test.yaml
#Â for datim
# ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_install_datim.yaml
# ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -i /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts ansible_install_datim_test.yaml
```

## macOS Installation

macOS does not include Java (since 10.7 and above), git, or wget. It includes unzip and PHP.

It is suggested to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```sh
brew install git wget
```

And install Java. Once requirements are created, install OpenInfoMan using the provided script in [resources/scripts](https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/tree/master/resources/scripts)


```sh
bash resources/scripts/install.sh
# and for additional libraries
bash resources/scripts/install_additional.sh
```

## Tests

The generic install without libraries and the libraries installations include simple tests. The tests do not cover the majority of functions, they are rather meant as a simple test for first level functionality in a help desk environment.

```sh
$ bash resources/scripts/install_test.sh
PASS [200]: Landing page
PASS [302]: Add test document
PASS [200]: List Shared Value Sets
PASS [200]: List Stored Functions
PASS [200]: Export Stored Functions
PASS [200]: List sample dirs
PASS [302]: Load provider sample dir
PASS [200]: Get providers sample dir
PASS [302]: Reload providers dir
PASS [302]: Delete providers sample dir
PASS [302]: Remove test document
```

```sh
$ bash resources/scripts/install_additional_test.sh
Which OpenInfoMan libraries do you wish to test?
1) All_public	     4) ILR		  7) Quit
2) All_DATIM	     5) RapidPro_and_CSV
3) DHIS		         6) HWR
#? 1
PASS [302]: DHIS - Load Sierra Leone demo as CSD
PASS [200]: DHIS - Get Sierra Leone demo as CSD
PASS [302]: DHIS - Delete Sierra Leone demo as CSD
PASS [200]: ILR - Download validate provider facility service
PASS [200]: CSV-RapidPro - Download CSV for import
PASS [200]: HWR - Get all facilities
```

## Backup and Restore

Logs and data are located in `data`. The logs are under data in the .logs folder. A one-liner can create a backup of the data in OpenInfoMan and a one-liner can restore it.

For example to backup data and logs and store them on S3:

```sh
basex -c"CREATE BACKUP provider_directory"
zip $HOME/openinfoman/data/logs-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M").zip $HOME/openinfoman/data/.logs
ls -la $HOME/openinfoman/data/
# move the logs and data zipfiles to a safe location, e.g.
aws s3 cp $HOME/openinfoman/data/logs-* s3://backup_bucket/logs
aws s3 cp $HOME/openinfoman/data/provider_directory-* s3://backup_bucket/data
# or
cp $HOME/openinfoman/data/logs-* ~/backup/logs
cp $HOME/openinfoman/data/provider_directory-* ~/backup/data
```

Restores require that just the name be used in the filename, e.g. `provider_directory`, and the additional timestamp will be ignored. For restores:

```sh
basex -c"RESTORE provider_directory"
```

The backup and restore process is the same on any operating system.

## Docker images

Docker builds suitable for testing are on https://hub.docker.com/r/openhie/openinfoman/ Note that the images do not use a mounted volume. This means that all data is removed when containers are destroyed. Releases are tagged with the SHA hash of the commit it is based upon in this repo.

To launch the latest Docker build:
```sh
docker run -d -p 8984:8984 docker pull openhie/openinfoman
```

See [packaging/docker](https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/tree/master/packaging/docker)for Dockerfiles to build your own image.

## Manual Installation

See the wiki https://github.com/openhie/openinfoman/wiki

## OpenInfoMan in Production

* OpenInfoMan does not include authentication or authorization. It is meant to be run inside a private cloud/cluster and behind a proxy. Follow instructions on this [wiki manual](https://wiki.ihris.org/wiki/OIM_authentication_with_OHIM) to add authentication using OpenHIM, or this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXLpNlMSZdM&feature=youtu.be or roll your own solution using another proxy with authentication.

* OpenInfoMan should be run by a user without superuser privileges. It is recommended to create a non-root and non-sudo user for running OpenInfoMan. This means that another user with sudo privileges should use used to install prerequisite software and then not used to run OpenInfoMan.

* Ensure that TCP port 8984 is open on security policy/firewall.

* Increase memory usage by modifying the `bin/basexhttp` shell script and uncomment
```sh
#VM=Xmx512m
```
then change to suitable values:
```sh
VM="-Xms2g -Xmx2g"
```

## Stored Functions

The base CSD standard can be extended using stored functions.

You can find documentation on the available stored functions across the OpenInfoMan libraries <a href="http://openhie.github.io/openinfoman/stored-functions">here</a>.
